          <!---Wayang Legends Act 5:
          Macchanu faced his father at last-Hanuman, no longer a legend, but a weathered, grieving soul—stood in silence as his son, born of tide and flame, unleashed years of pain in every strike.Their battle echoed with memory: a mother’s lullaby, a seed planted in secret, a legacy hidden by fear.
          
          As their blades clashed, the truth spilled forth—not of betrayal, but of loss. Hanuman had never known the child survived; Macchanu had never known his father searched. And as the Seed of Fate awakened between them, glowing with ancient light, Macchanu stood at the edge of choice: to finish the war with vengeance, to build a bridge with forgiveness, or to walk away and let silence swallow history once more.--->
